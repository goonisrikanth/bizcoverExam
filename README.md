Bizcover_QA_PracticalExam

This solution contains a test framework which is built from Cucumber, TestNG and Selenium WebDriver.
Note: 

All the TestData (including Email Address) is dynamic in nature. For state we are always selecting the first option.

-----

Technologies Used: 

•	Selenium Webdriver: UI Automation Tool

•	TestNG: Test Execution Framework

•	Lombok: Short-hand syntax for Getters and Setters 

•	JFairy: To generate TestData

•	Cucumber: BDD






-----

Executing the Tests:

We can execute the created in test in 2 ways:

1.  mvn install

2.  Run as TestNG Test

-----
Below things were expected out of the Framework, please find the inline comments.

1. New user should be registered. Would be great if the email address is randomly generated so as for the test to be reuseable – All the User Data is Autogenerated

2. The user should be able to log in to the system after a successful registration – Done, checking for Signout link after registration

3. Please upload your solution to your github account and provide us the link. It is also desirable if you can attach a Test Report which shows the test result – Done.
